## Overview 🤖

  The project aims to develop a system for violence detection using CCTV footage and providing an immediate alert to the police. The system will use advanced image     processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the CCTV footage in real-time and detect any violent behavior or actions. Once detected, an automatic alert     will be sent to the police, enabling them to respond quickly and take appropriate action. The system has the potential to enhance public safety and reduce crime     rates in public areas.
