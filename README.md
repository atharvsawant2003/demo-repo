 Violence detection ML model to detect suspicious activities in real-time through CCTV or any camera, and send immediate alert to the respective¬†authorities.
 
 



## Overview ü§ñ

  The project aims to develop a system for violence detection using CCTV footage and providing an immediate alert to the police. The system will use advanced image     processing and machine learning techniques to analyze the CCTV footage in real-time and detect any violent behavior or actions. Once detected, an automatic alert     will be sent to the police, enabling them to respond quickly and take appropriate action. The system has the potential to enhance public safety and reduce crime     rates in¬†public¬†areas.
  
## Usage

To use this project, you need to have a webcam connected to your computer. The project will capture the video stream from the webcam and analyze it for any violent activities. If any violence is detected, the project will send an alert to the respective authorities with the location and timestamp of the incident.

## Features ü¶æ

- Weapon Detection
- Light/dark mode toggle
- Enhance the user experience creating highly reactive website.
